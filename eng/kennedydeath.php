                    <h2>Who killed John F. Kennedy?</h2> <p>The assassination of John F. Kennedy is one of the most mysterious and debated events of the twentieth century. On November 22, 1963, the 35th President of the United States was fatally shot with a rifle while he and his wife Jacqueline were traveling in the presidential motorcade on Elm Street in Dallas, Texas1. Lee Harvey Oswald, an American citizen who had previously lived in the Soviet Union, was arrested on suspicion of committing this crime2. However, Oswald was also assassinated two days after his arrest while being escorted to prison.3</p> <p>A formal investigation in 1964, led by a commission headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren of the U.S. Supreme Court (the "Warren Commission"), concluded that Oswald acted alone and had no accomplices or clients.1 However, this conclusion did not satisfy many Americans and the world community, who saw the Kennedy assassination as the result of a conspiracy by American or Soviet intelligence services, the mafia, Cubans, or other forces4. According to opinion polls, the overwhelming majority of Americans (over 70%) do not believe in the official version of the assassination1.</p> <p>In 2017-2022, thousands of archival documents about the Kennedy assassination were released in the United States, which were made public by a 1992 law2. However, no major revelations are expected, but historians hope to learn more about what Oswald was doing in Mexico City, where he met with a KGB agent in October 19632. The documents may also include witness statements, recordings from President LBJ's tape recorder, and other information that could help us better understand the course of the investigation and Oswald's motives.</p>
                    <h2>The consequences of the Kennedy assassination</h2> <p>The assassination of John F. Kennedy was a tragedy not only for his family and friends, but also for the entire country and the world. Kennedy was a popular and charismatic leader who embodied the hopes and dreams of millions of Americans. He was also an active participant in international politics, dealing with issues of nuclear disarmament, the fight against communism, support for human rights and the development of the space program.</p> <p>After Kennedy's assassination, Lyndon Johnson became the next president of the United States, continuing some of his predecessor's initiatives, such as civil rights reform, poverty alleviation and education. However, Johnson also increased American involvement in the Vietnam War, which caused massive protests and public discontent. Johnson did not run for a second term in 1968, when his 1960 running mate, Robert F. Kennedy, was also assassinated.</p> <p>JFK's assassination also led to a general increase in security for the presidency and the US Secret Service. New measures were introduced to control access to the president, his transportation, and the protection of his home. Also, the Presidential Protection Act of 1965 was passed, which prohibited anyone from approaching the president without the permission of the Secret Service.</p>
